## About

This is an experimental piece of work, originally created as homework of *Software Engineering Introduction*. Web UI was not carefully prettified (just forget that) . You can refer to my [blog post](https://queensferry.coding.me/2018/12/22/%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E-Vue-js-%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0%E9%80%92%E5%BD%92%E6%A0%91%E5%BD%A2%E5%AF%BC%E8%88%AA%E6%A0%8F%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6%E4%BB%A5%E5%8F%8A%E9%A1%B5%E9%9D%A2%E9%94%9A%E7%82%B9%E5%90%8C%E6%AD%A5%E6%BB%9A%E5%8A%A8/) to have some insight into this project.
